Hello everyone welcome to a new Decred News Update. I’m your host Exitus, and I’m going to being covering everything going on in the Decred ecosystem. 

The Devs are continually sharing bits of information on the progress of the big 1.6.0 r elease.The DEX, for instance, is in its final stages of development.

Chappjc reports The first DCR-BTC mainnet atomic swaps coordinated by #dcrdex were conducted yesterday.  Testing and development continues.

Decred Jesus already has the DCRDEX running on mainnet. Mainnet testing is private and invite only for now, but testnet remains open to everyone.

The DCR DEX of course does not collect personal data, has no fees, no utility tokens, and never takes custody of your funds. Trades are done via Atomic swaps.

The monero community has provided the funds necessary to fund Atomic Swap development on Monero, so hopefully we will see an XMR to DCR pair on the DEX in the future.

Project Lead Jake Yocom Piatt says he and DCR contractors are here to win the war, not small battles, and that the DEX will be the new battlefield.

dcrd version 1.6.0 with the features we’ve all been waiting for has been merged on Github indicating a release in the near future. However, there is still on-going work in many other repos for 1.6.0 as Decred Developer davecgh noted on a Forward Thinking Friday post on Reddit. DCRD is just one small piece of the total puzzle.

The DCR On-Chain website has finally arrived. This is.a live, interactive website that displays on-chain and performance metrics, charts, analysis and research. This website was funded by the Decred DAO via Politeia, and is a testament to Decred’s governance abilities of building out infrastructure for the community. Visit dcronchain.com to see the site for yourself.

The lightning network for Decredition is inbound. Decred contractor Guisso from Brazil says Prepare for the future of payments, last improvements to Decrediton with LN support have been made! The Lightning Network is a 2nd layer scaling solution that allows for near instance transactions that scales by the millions.

A test running blocks with the Decentralized Treasury rules has passed, reports Decred Dev Marco Peereboom. Luke Powell says the DCR treasury will be the largest transfer of power away from a founding team in the history of the Crypto Ecosystem. The Decred 1.6.0 Release is going to be massive, it’s obvious lots of polish and hard work has gone into it.

The total coin supply has recently passed 12 million. Like Bitcoin, there will only be 21 million Decred ever in circulation. The block reward does decrease by 1% every 21 days. This combined with the fact that close to 51% of the supply is locked in the hybrid proof of stake/proof of work mining system and 8.6% of the supply is currently held in the soon to be Decentralized treasury, means decred is a very, very scarce asset, and it will only be more difficult to obtain once the market fully understands the infrastructure being built into the Decred protocol.

If you haven’t already done so, make sure to upgrade to decred version 1.5.2. - It addresses a recently discovered issue that could, under certain circumstances allow for nodes to be hit with a denial of service attack. People running their own nodes as well as Proof-of-Work miners are advised to upgrade.

Withdecred.org has launched. This is an educational site featuring easy to understand articles which will be great for introducing newbies to Decred. The website creator Pavel also plans to create a prize based incentive program to go along with the site in order to attract new people to learn about Decred.

The Decred Bug Bounty program has been updated. There have been 141 submissions so far, with 14 of them being eligible for a payout. There have also been some rule changes to improve the program.

Monde PR was able to secure new Decred related Media.

Decred Project Lead Jake Yocom Piatt was featured on Finance Magnates in an article titled Are Crypto Platforms Taking Personal Data Protection Seriously Enough?

Jake was also featured on Cointelegraph talking about the safety of Hardware wallets and how they sometimes overlook software security because it falls outside of their product offering. He also says the security against remote theft is normally offset because there is a distinct decrease in privacy since the hardware wallet supplier can see exactly which coins a wallet controls.”

Decred lead developer Dave Collins was featured in an article on The Daily Chain to clarify the recent vulnerability that was patched in version 1.5.2 saying not 100% of Decred nodes were at risk, that only nodes that accept inbound P2P messages would be at risk, and that Decred developers were the ones that developed the patch for Decred, not outside Bitcoin Developers.


He says protecting personal data is a much more complex process, and that Protecting digital bearer assets is a matter of protecting a very small amount of information: your private keys,” he said, adding that “there are a variety of tools for doing this, e.g. hardware wallets.”

There was also lots of community activity, including new podcasts, videos, and other content produced.

Elian from the Latin America team was on Fintech Advisory Services to talk about the future of organizational structure.

The Latin America team has been up to alot and you can review everything they’ve been doing on their newly released report on the Decredd subreddit.

Decred Contractor Checkmate released a new research piece called Mining Market Mechanics, he even published a video walkthrough explaining the paper that is available right here on the Decred YouTube channel.

To summarize the paper, he say: 

- GPU miners dumped everything they mined
- ASIC miners have serious skin in the game but have massive overheads to recover
- Weak and outdated mined have likely capitulated
- DCR coin and vote distribution is epic, just as PoW was designed

A new Decred Focused podcast titled Staked hosted by Eduardo Lima was published to Spotify and Youtube. He has already produced a few episodes so be sure to check it out.

The YouTube channel Decred Society Published a few new videos.

Now let's look at what’s been happening on Politeia, decred’s public proposal platform which supports the governance of the protocol. We had our first ever Request for Proposal submitted and approved to change the messaging on Decred.org, and now there is active voting on the subsequent proposals submitted.

The Decred Content And Asset Translation Proposal has been submitted.

This proposal formalizes the on-going translation work done for the Decred project in order to reach a more international audience and provide professional translations for the content and software of the project.

There’s a maximum budget of $40,000 USD payable in Decred over a 6 month period. The listed languages so far are Polish, Arabic, Spanish, Chinese and Portuguese, with room for two more languages to be added.

Work to be translated includes the Decred Journal, video content, the decred website, various articles, and translation for software.

Comments thus far have expressed support for translations because they are from proven community members, help expand the decred community, and would help with a more grassroots marketing growth approach.

Other comments have expressed concern over the budget and effectiveness of the proposal, especially with Decred’s falling exchange rate and the modernized use of services like Google Translate.

Kozel says the budget is a high maximum which he says will likely not come close to being hit, and that the average billed by translation contractors is much lower.

The RFP to change Decred’s messaging on Decred.org is currently underway with the DREAM proposal in the lead.

The DREAM proposal explores the idea that Decred is the Chad Coin, and that we’ve been overthinking our marketing and messaging, using “virgin words” instead of “chad” words (chad being a symbol of the apex alpha male).

JZ, the proposer, believes the Tagline “Decred: Sound Money Evolved” should be used. although he says no one should vote for his proposal, though should it pass, he will come up with further chad-like messaging. There are no costs associated with this proposal.

Richard Red’s proposal advocates for changing the tagline to “Money Evolved” after seeing the positive comments on the DREAM proposal, the initial tagline was Stakeholder-Governed Sound Money for a Fairer Financial System.

He also wants to add a “fair” box and use the words “fair, adaptable, and secure”, removing the word sustainable, though keeping the content associated with sustainable on the site. He has written up a beautiful Fair Page Copy which explores why Fiat currencies are rigged and that Decred is building a fairer financial system.

The maximum budget for this proposal is $3,800.

Haon’s proposal advocates for the “Money Evovled Tagline” with the addition of adding a blurb on the Decred homepage about how we are living in disruptive, uncertain times, and that Decerd is the answer to these uncertainties as it is evolving money with a host of features like Politeia, DEX, Atomic Swaps, and the lightning network.

The maximum budget for this proposal is $2,100.

Mrbulb’s proposal is about changing the tagline to “Building Revolutionary Infrastructure” with a follow up of “Decred is an sustainably funded open source software project, coordinating a decentralized community of stakeholders to build a secure and adaptable payments network, creating foundations for a fairer financial future. He also wants to include the same Fair page copy from RIchard’s Proposal.

His proposal also budgets for changing the look and layout of the decred website, with an example screenshot given.

The maximum budget is $5,000.

The Grassroots Marketing Proposal from WithDecred passed with 62% yes votes and a voter participation of 37%.

This proposal authorizes the use of $5,000 USD in Decred to be distributed among new users on a pseudo-random “earned distribution” model via giveaways on Twitter and other methods the WithDecred team comes up with. $1485 is also reserved for website maintenance and fees. It is expected these funds will last 5 months.

This will be an interesting test to see if free decred giveaways results in a tangible improvement to marketing and awareness.
