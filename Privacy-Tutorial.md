## Privacy Tutorial


#### Intro
In this tutorial I will Explore Decred's Privacy features and show you how to anonymize your Decred using the Mixnet built right into Decred's Wallet Decredition. 

#### Begin Tutorial In Wallet

So here we have a wallet with 5 Decred. Everything we need is in the Privacy Tab located on the left hand side.

We'll need to authorize the wallet to create 2 new accounts, one called Umixed and the Other Called Mixed.

To do this click "Create Default Account" and enter your password.

The way this works is the mixer passes your funds from your Unmixed account through the Decred Mixnet, with the newly mixed coins arriving in your Mixed Account.

This is a completely non-custodial process meaning you never lose ownership of your DCR, and there are no risks with mixing your Decred.

So first we need to send our Decred from our default account to the unmixed account which we can do right here. There's a button you can press which will select all of the account funds, then press "Send to Self".

Now that our funds are in the unmixed account, we can start up the Mixer.

Your Decred will sift through the mixer in increments, arriving in the Mixed account completely anonymized, with all past history wiped away.

The mixing occurs in epochs of 20 minutes, so it may take a bit of time for your mix to occur.

Decred's mixnet is integrated with its Proof of Stake system, so there is always plenty of other Decred to mix with.

Notice by going to On-Chain Transactions you can only send from your mixed account, and receive into your unmixed account or default account. This is the wallets way of helping you not to mess up your privacy by keeping the mixed and unmixed Decred separate.

You can disable this feature if you'd prefer in the Privacy tab.

You can also see all of the transactions that took place with the mixes, and the fees associated with them.

These mixes are very cheap to perform, as you can see this mix only cost me $.002

Now that you've enabled Privacy, you can privately stake, provided you have enough Decred to Purchase a ticket. I will cover the process of Staking in another tutorial.

As of this video nearly 30% of all Decred in circulation has been mixed, with mixing participation growing every day, especially now that Decredition users can mix. The end goal is for Decred to be a fungibile cryptocurrency, where every unit of Decred is equal to every other unit.

Decred's CoinShuffle++ Mixing protocol was chosen because it's simplicity makes it audit-able, and it allows for blockchain pruning.
