## What?

The purpose of this proposal is to continue a budget for work involving the creation and administration of video content as well as general video editing support for the Decred project over the next 6 months.

## Why?

Video content is arguably the most popular form of media today. Having a presence on platforms like YouTube, Bitchute, and even Twitter is paramount to promoting the project and helping spread awareness and educating new users. Utitilzing YouTube is a powerful way to show off the project's updates, progress, and have new eyes on the project.


## What Kind Of Work Is Involved in This Proposal?

- Bi-Weekly News Updates displaying general news and progress that the project is making.
- Explainer and “How To” videos. I look forward to creating videos on how to use LN, the DEX, Privacy, etc
- General Decred Videos
- Smaller form Videos for the likes of Twitter.
- Video editing support for any community members that may request it. (Example: DCR Australia, Checkmate, etc)
- Video material for Events (Example: Consensus 2020)

Videos are uploaded to Decred's YouTube & Bitchute Channel.

## Who?

Work is done by myself, Exitus. I have been a Decred advocate and Stakeholder for over 3 years.


## Metrics from Phase 1

Metrics are an important way to gauge what works and what doesn’t work. While we have to trust 3rd party platforms for these gameable analytics, I believe the metrics provided by YouTube are for the most part accurate.

| YouTube Metric| Value Over Last 6 Months |
|-------------|---------|
| Views       | 20,969  |
| Like %      | 98.8%   |
| Subs Gained | 470     |
| Subs Lost   | 248     |
| Comments    | 163     |

| Traffic Source   |   % Over Last 6 Months    |
|------------------|-------|
| YouTube Search   | 28.2% |
| External         | 20.5% |
| Browse Features  | 19.3% |
| Suggested Videos | 10.3% |
| Channel Pages    | 9.2%  |
| Others           | 12.5% |

Most popular video: DCR 101 - How to Stake Decred [2020]: 1,514 Views

Bitchute View Count: 1,531 (Channel started April 14th)

Views on various videos uploaded to Twitter: 18,291 

## Thoughts

I would like to see these numbers much higher, however, I feel that this overlaps with wider discussion surrounding how to facilitate marketing and bring more awareness to the project. More general awareness of Decred will naturally see more hits and subs on the Decred YouTube Channel.

With the absence of Marketing Lead Dustorf and thus the suspension of most of the funds for The United States Marketing Proposal (Marketing for the English speaking world) external marketing efforts to bring users to our platforms has been somewhat minimal over the past 6 months.

I am convinced that with more unique, community focused marketing efforts we can boost numbers for content produced across all mediums, not just videos.

Throughout Phase 1 I recieved lots of positive feedback, which I was happy to see. I look forward to creating more videos for the Decred community.

If anyone has any thoughts, ideas, or would like to work with me, please feel free to message me on Matrix/Twitter.

Note: I had planned for more videos during Phase 1 in hopes that 1.6.0 would be released. I’d prefer to create videos for that release once those features are thoroughly polished and live so the videos will be more tangible to viewers and not just “ Feature X, Y, and Z is Coming Soon™”.

## Budget & Duration:

Max cap of $2,500/Month payable in Decred, invoiced via the Contractor Management System. 

Starting immediately and ending in 6 months time.
