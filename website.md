Decred - Money Evolved (wallets, exchanges)
 
Decred is a cryptocurrency designed to evolve over time based on the direction of its coin-holders.

## Why Decred?
(NARRATIVE FOCUS)
 
Decred was conceived by a team of Bitcoin developers working with legendary Monero developer tacotime. Their vision was clear: empower coinholder control through a unique hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining system that blends security, decentralization, and user participation.

 “Decred's killer feature is good governance, and with good governance, you can have any feature you want” - Chris Burniske & Joel Monegro, Placeholder Ventures
 
“If I understand it correctly, #Decred could solve most of #Bitcoin's structural problems.” - Cathie Wood, ARK Invest
 
## Decred Puts Coinholders in Control
 
Anyone who stakes Decred has direct voting rights on protocol changes, proposals, and treasury spending. Stakers earn a portion of the block subsidy for their participation. 
 
##  Development That Never Stops
 
Decred's treasury is completely self-funded and comes from 10% of the block reward. This funding model ensures that development, marketing, and other project-related activities have a consistent funding source, independent of external capital or sponsors.

## Proposals 
 
Decred’s proposal platform is the decision making force behind the Decred DAO. Anyone can submit a proposal to build on Decred and get funding from the Decred treasury. All proposals are time-anchored and censorship resistant. 

## DAO

The combination of the treasury fund, proposal platform, stakeholder voting, and flexible contractor model allows Decred to operate as a Layer 1 Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
 
## Untraceable Transactions
 
Decred has integrated an opt-in coin mixing process into its hybrid mining system. This allows users to easily anonymize their coins through a mixnet. 
 
 ## DEX
 
Decred has built its own DEX using atomic-swap technology. This allows users to trade peer-to-peer with no trading fees or KYC. DEX development is funded by the Decred Treasury and is completely open-source.
 
## Dual-Layer Security
 
Decred's hybrid system requires majority control of both mining power and staked coins to pull off a 51% attack, making it significantly more difficult. To date, Decred has never been majority attacked.

## Lightning Network For Scalability
 
Decred is the only project other than Bitcoin taking Lighting development seriously for Layer 2 scaling. Check out Bison Relay, a P2P uncensorable communications platform prototyperunning on Decred's LN.
