## Why Decred?

Decred was conceived by a team of Bitcoin developers working with legendary Monero developer tacotime.

Their vision was clear: empower coinholders through a unique hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining system that blends security, sustainability, decentralization, and user participation.

Decred is a combination of the words "Decentralized" and "Credits" (yes, no?)


## Explore More / Decred Puts Coinholders in Control

Anyone who stakes Decred has direct voting rights on network changes, proposals, and treasury spending. Stakers earn a portion of the block reward for their participation.


## Explore More / Development That Never Stops

Decred's treasury is self-funded and comes from 10% of the block reward. This funding model ensures that development, marketing, and other project-related activities have a consistent funding source, independent of external capital or sponsors.


## Explore More / Proposals

Decred’s proposal platform is the decision making force behind the Decred DAO. Anyone can submit a proposal to build and get funding from the treasury. All proposals are time-anchored, censorship resistant, and must be approved by stakeholders.


## Explore More / DAO

The combination of the treasury fund, proposal platform, stakeholder voting, and flexible contractor model allow Decred to operate as a Layer 1 Decentralized Autonomous Organization.


## Explore More / Untraceable Transactions

Decred has integrated an opt-in coin mixing process into its hybrid mining system. This allows users to easily anonymize their coins through a mixnet.


## Explore More / DEX

Decred has built its own DEX using atomic-swap technology. This allows users to trade peer-to-peer with no trading fees or KYC. DEX development is funded by the Decred DAO and is completely open-source.


## Explore More / Dual-Layer Security

Decred's hybrid consensus system is significantly more difficult to 51% attack than pure PoW or PoS systems. To date, Decred has never been majority attacked.

Decred is the only project other than Bitcoin taking Lighting development seriously for Layer 2 scaling. Check out Bison Relay, a P2P uncensorable communications prototype running on Decred's LN.
