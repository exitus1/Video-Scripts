#### Decred bi-Weekly News Update - Development Progress, Staking Participation All Time High - And More!


## Opening

Hi and Welcome to this weeks Decred News Update, I'm host your Exitus and Id really appreciate it if you'd hit that subscribe button and hit the like button if you end up getting anything of value out of this video.

We'll start with the most exciting and important element of the Project; Development updates

## Dev Updates

Decred version 1.6 is now in Release Candidate Number #3 with more improvements.

There are now logs in the privacy tab showing exactly what the Coinshuffle++ Mixer is doing when you start it up.

Mockups for the Privacy Tab by Decred Designers EETER were presented on Github showcasing what the finalized version could look like. Users should be able to send from their default wallet to their unmixed wallet in this tab without having to go to seperate tab. This makes the process of participating in Decred's privacy even easier, and the wallet itself easier to navigate.

With more users trying out the Release Candidate, the number of mixed coins per day is naturally increasing as shown on dcrdata.org

When you purchase a ticket via the new vspd Stakepool system it will automatically send the ticket through the Mixnet, and you pay the Stakepool fee to the Stakepool as part of the initial transaction and not from your block reward.

There is even a new tab displaying Ticket Status.

Trezor Staking Support is in progress. Decred devs have decided to roll with their own firmware as it might take a long time for the required changes in Trezors firmware to get merged.

Coinshuffle++ Privacy Mixer Support in Mobile Wallets is currently in progress as well.

The Treasury Decentralized rules passed on Test-net without a hitch meaning the upgrade on Mainnet is expected to go smooth as well. This will be Decred's biggest and arguably most important consensus change vote to date, so get your tickets ready.

Consensus changes require atleast 75% yes votes and a voter quorum or participation percentage of atleast 10%.

Remember, the big deal about Decred is that it has an operational change mechanism built into the protocol and therefore can be adapted in the future based on the will of its stakeholders. This means the protocol will likely never stagnate or deal with community breaking forks as it has a way to implement new features or modify old ones. It's really only a matter of time before the market realizes the power and technology contained within the Decred Ecosystem.

Once Decred Decentralizes its Treasury, it will be one of the biggest DAOs in all of Crypto Currency.


## DEX

The DEX continues to execute trades via Atomic swaps, enabling permissionless price discovery.

The impressive buy walls on the DEX have yet to cease. It appears not having to submit your personal information to an exchange or losing custody of your funds has made the DEX an attractive option for bitcoiners to hedge into DCR.

A Litecoin pair should be made available soon. Given Litecoins low transactions fees, it is likely the minimum LOT size will be much smaller, and this could potentially be a popular pair to trade on.

Lots of development work has been complete such as:

- implementing optional SegWit BTC swap contracts (saves ~30% in tx fees)
- generation of new deposit addresses
 - client Tor support
- UI improvements
- market suspend/resume functionality
- resolve match status on startup
- And many other improvements and bug fixes.


An API to display volume and other data is in the works as well for dcrdata.org

Check out decred journal on medium.com for a more complete and in depth list of all of the Development work going on for Decred, it is seriously impressive.


## Community Now 
#### Plenty of excellent content was produced by the Community like the Decred in Depth and Rough Consensus Podcasts.

Project Lead Jake Yocom-Piatt was on the Brave New Coin Podcast.



## Network Stats:

#### Now lets explore some network stats.



The Decred Ticket Price needed to participate in the Proof Of Stake Goverance system hit an all time high of 188.85 DCR per ticket! 

An all time high of 52.77% of the Decred circulating supply was locked away in this system, showing incredible confidence in Decred by its Holders due to the fact that tickets are chosen randomly, and can take upwards of 4.7 months to be selected to vote.

It can be speculated that the DEX buyers are here for the long haul.

It's always bitter sweet to see the ticket price go up so much because it means there's so much confidence in the Decred Network, but at the same time the higher ticket price means there is less tickets to go around for each stakeholder.

## Decred saw plenty of Media Coverage secured by Monde PR.

Brazil has Implemented the Decred Blockchain for its 2020 elections. This news was syndicated to several different organizations including geekinsider, and cryptobriefing, among others.

Donations are made in the Brasilian Real through the Voto Legal platform. The final hash is written on Decred’s public blockchain, which generates an immutable transaction. It records the name of the person donating and the amount donated along with the date and hour. This guarantees the authenticity of the transactions, promoting reliability in the electoral donation process.

Jake Yocom-Piatt, Co-Founder and Project Lead at Decred.org said: “Decred was created to champion individual sovereignty. Our governance system is ruled by the collective intelligence of our community to enable truly decentralized decision-making, so it’s rewarding to see our technology utilized in an election, which has the same goal."

At a time where people are seeking transparency in the political process, Decred is leading the way.

Decred Open Source Researcher Richard Red released his Politeia Year 2 Research results.

He writes that in Year 2:

    46 proposals have been published.
    38 proposals have been voted on 
    Of those, 21 have been approved and 17 rejected.
    Proposal votes have an average (mean) turnout of 27.9%, with a total of 431,496 ticket votes being cast.
    6 proposals have been abandoned before voting started.
    There have been 1,327 comments on Politeia proposals.
    There have been 4,090 up/down votes on comments.
    
 Voters were less likely to vote yes on Proposals this year.  He says Mean approval percentage for year 2 proposals that pass was 78.7%, in year 1 this was 85.9%.
 
 This year, nearly half of proposals came from Contractors already working on the project.

It's truly fascinating to watch Politeia grow and the data around it be studied.

## Politeia
#### Now lets take a look at what is currently going on with Politeia, Decred's Proposal Platform.

We had three different proposals finish voting, and one that will be abandoned.

The whydecred.com proposal is set to be abandoned as the proposer paris smithson has decided to do the work first and produce an initial minimum release of the website in order to better show Stakeholders what they will be getting.


The GODCR Golang Native Desktop Wallet proposal passed with 92% yes votes, with a 38% voter turnout. In total 14,249 votes were cast.

The Mobile Wallets proposal passed with 92% yes votes as well with a 38% voter turnout. in total 14,189 votes were cast.


And Finally the Decred ADdress Scanner proposal passed wtih 67% yes votes and a voter turnout of 34%. In total there were 13,701 votes cast.
