Hi and welcome to this weeks Decred News update, I’m your host Exitus. We’ll be going over everything in the Decred Ecosystem. First up we’ll start with Development updates we are currently in RC4 For decred 1.6

When starting up Decrediton Release Candidate 4, the first thing I noticed was the tabs in the wallets have been rearranged.

Normal transactions are called "on-chain" transactions, with Lightning Network Transactions just below it.

The Privacy tab has been completely redesigned for an easier user experience. Users can quickly send funds from their default wallet to their unmixed wallet, and get to mixing their coins to anonymize their DCR.

Mixed transactions now have their own icon as well.

Over 23% of the DCR has already mixed, and this number will only go up  once 1.6 has released.

It really feels like this release is the complete package for decred, with years of work coming together.

Decred v1.6 of course has the privacy mixer, LN, easier ways to stake, and a more private way to stake. To date this will be Decred’s biggest release by far.

The following dev updates have been merged to master:

DCRwallet uses random coin selection for all regular sends.

Trezor Firmware has been updated and Trezor ticket purchasing is being tested on testnet.

GODCR, a new upcoming Desktop wallet has had a UI overhaul. Work is also being done to add VSPD an Politeia proposal support.

On the Decred IOS mobile wallet work is being down to add privacy and Politeia proposals.

Updates and bug fixes were made to Rosetta DCR.

The Decred DEX had a large number of tweaks and bug fixes such as transaction confirmation counts, more chart interactivity, no trading while the blockchain is syncing, improved shutdown, optimized memory usage of order books, configurable lot limits for new users and users with good swap history, load testing bot to stress the system, a spec for the DEX clients RPC protocol to help programs other than, for instance, Decredition sue the DEX client, and much, much more.

In progress is Max order estimation, user reputation, and market data API endpoints so that external parties can pull data from the DEX.

For Politeia, 2 factor authentication support using 6 digit codes for login will be supported.

Politeia also had numerous design and bug fixes.

On the Contractor Management System, work is being down to add tracking for Github activity stats which will be used to ensure that developers’ progress matches their billed hours.

Support for 2 factor authentication is also being added.


DEX developer Chappjc says Now we should tackle SPV, GUI integration, more coins, and simpler onboarding.


The Decred DEX still has impressive buy walls, with, at times, over 11,000 Decred on the buy side. You can view the DEX market for yourself at explorer.decred.org/market. DEX developer Chappjc says Now we should tackle SPV, GUI integration, more coins, and simpler on-boarding. As of now the DEX is only available for setup via command line, which has proven to be difficult for most community members.

Remember, the DEX proposal did not include a working GUI, only a Minimum viable product.

As always, I recommend viewers to follow the Decred Journal on Medium.com or publish0x to read about every single development update.

Decred deposits were suspended on the Korean Exchange upbit which led to the price rising dramatically with no possibility of arbitraging from other exchanges. Decred is being delisted from Upbit for being a privacy coin. Community member JZ, who deals with exchanges, informed Upbit of Decred’s privacy features, explaining to them that Decred’s privacy is opt in. It is now in Upbit’s hands whether or not they will keep Decred listed on their exchange.

Decred Analyst Checkmate has released a new website called. This is a great resource for Decred and Bitcoin Metrics.

The decred ticket price for staking hit a new high of 190.99 DCR per ticket. Stake participation also hit a new high of 54.17%

We also saw lots of community activity like podcasts and videos created.



Frank Braun was on the Rough Consensus Podcast.

Seth Simmons was on Decred in Depth to talk Privacy.

Decred developer Luke Powell was on the Digital Cash Network podcast to talk  Decred Governance, Hybrid Consensus, and New Decentralized Treasury

Decred Motion Designer Kyle Firethought has released a number of decred motion graphic resources on lottiefiles.com https://lottiefiles.com/decred for community members to utilize at their own will to continue to build out the Decred Brand by incorporating these graphics into their own websites or other projects. Lots of useful assets here available in a wide range of formats.

Decred Contractor Insaf Nori from Morocco signed a partnership agreement with the Moroccan Organization of Young Decision Makers in order to work together in the technological field for the benefit of the youth.

This allows Decred community members in Morocco to represent decred and blockchain technology through events and workshops.

Popular trading exchange Binance has added margin trading for both the BTC and USDT Decred pairs. While this could bring about more liquidity, I strongly recommend viewers to avoid gambling with their funds on Binance via Margin Trading.

Decred Society put out a new video talking about Decred's Proof Of Work Mining.

We also had more news updates from Monde PR.

Decred Project lead jake yocom piatt was featured in Cointelegraph talking about the rationale behind the bitcoin bull and bear cycles.

He says Bitcoin’s bull and bear cycles are functions of generic human psychology, attention spans, and its deterministic and diminishing issuance

And that bull runs occur when demand begins to outstrip supply which gets the attention of Investors. The rate of supply of Bitcoin is constantly shrinking as a percentage of the total circulation, with the addition of a substantial supply shock every halvening

Decred does not halve, instead its block reward decreases by 1% every 21 days, which prevents shocking miners.

Jake was also featured on Nasdaq talking about the use of Decred in Brazil's elections.

Jake was also in another Cointelegraph article where he stated that the U.S was the most crypto friendly country. He says Cryptocurrency transactions are a form of speech, so states where free speech is protected are the least likely to restrict cryptocurrencies. While the U.S. currently suffers from many substantial socio political problems, the combination of its freedom of speech with protections against forced disclosure of passphrases makes it the most crypto-friendly country in the world.”

And to wrap up the PR news, Decred was featured as a coin whose price has been going up in the Bitcoin bull market, noting the recent DEX launch and the use of Decred in the Brazil 2020 elections.

While I try not to focus on the exchange rate, it is positive to see Decred's exchange rate increasing both in USD and Bitcoin. This attracts more investors, and even better, it means the Decred Treasury becomes all the more powerful.

Everytime Decred increases 1 US Dollar in price, the value of the treasury increases 635,000$

With more money in the Decred DAO, the more projects we can fund.

The Decred DAO can be one of the biggest DAOs in all of Cryptocurrency.

We had 2 proposals up for vote on Politeia.

First up is the Decred in Spanish Communications and Content Creation Proposal 3 from elian.

This proposal seeks to continue the on-going work of spreading Decred in the Spanish speaking world by the Latin America team via content creation, user support, design, public relations, and community organization, among other efforts.

The initial asking amount was $42000 payable in decred but it has since been reduced down to $14,800 due to feedback from the community. Basically, commenters on Politeia said they would like to see a more unique approach to marketing that is different from what has been attempted in the past, pointing at metrics like Price and growth.

The LATAM team responded by saying they never promised they could make number go up, but they themselves delivered on establishing a Spanish speaking community for Decred, laying the groundwork for it to grow and thrive. 

The Decred LATAM team has an extensive list of all of the work they have completed thus far over the last 6 months compiled on Reddit.

With the pandemic still on-going, in person events have been completely canceled, so they had pivoted to more online content, often hosting guests from other parts of the Crypto Spanish speaking world as well as creating general video content. They even hosted a hackathon for decred to attract developers.

The hackathon was cut from the budget in order to appease stakeholders who want to reduce expenditures on marketing, and it has been turned into its own proposal.

The Decred Hackathons and LATAM Initial Chapter Proposal from Pablito requests a budget of $17,000 USD payable in Decred to create a template for Hackathons and also run hackathons to promote decred to the spanish speaking Developer community.

This includes creating content to educate developers and creating ongoing challenges and bounties in order to expand the Developer community.
Pablito says work will be translated to English for more global use.

The proposal received mixed criticism, with some supporting more development activity, and others noting hackathons do not have more substantial use by the broader community.
