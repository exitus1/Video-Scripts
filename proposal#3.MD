### What

This proposal seeks funding for the creation and administration of video content to support the Decred project over the next 6 months beginning 4.1.2021.

### Why

Video content is a powerful and immensely popular way of inducing education, spreading awareness, and generating hype. Having a presence on platforms like YouTube, Bitchute, Twitter etc. is a benefit to Decred.

It is important to maintain a social media presence in order to best market Decred and display the health of the project as it continuously adapts, upgrades, and expands utilizing its unique suite of governance features.

### Who

In addition to myself, I am happy to include two new community members who have created video content: [Karamble](https://twitter.com/karamblez) and [Decred Society](https://twitter.com/DecredSociety) to this proposal.

Decred Society has produced a number of Decred related videos which can be viewed on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DecredSociety/featured).

Karamable, a long time Decred contributor, has proven his skills in After Effects by producing Decred related animations. 

Examples of Karamble's work:

- [DCRDEX Is Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwGJyRBjdtM)
- [1.6 Release Promo](https://twitter.com/karamblez/status/1356921573647745024)
- [1.6 Promo #2](https://twitter.com/karamblez/status/1324812207222304770)
- [8-Bit Promo](https://twitter.com/karamblez/status/1353843046606106628)



### Roles:

[Decred Society](https://twitter.com/DecredSociety) - Focus on Decred Fundamentals. Video ideas include:

- How does De­cred build on Bit­coins ori­gin­al design?
- How does De­cred’s Treas­ury make the pro­ject more sus­tain­able?
- How De­cent­ral­ised can De­cred be­come?
- Com­par­ing the se­cur­ity of pure POW with De­cred’s Hy­brid solu­tion
- Why is be­ing fork res­ist­ant so im­port­ant?
-  How does a pro­ject get lis­ted on the DCR­DEX?

[Exitus](https://twitter.com/exitusdcr) - Focus on News Updates, Tutorials, assist Decred Society with video creation and general editing, provide video editing support for the Decred Project.

[Karamble](https://twitter.com/karamblez) - Focus on Video and Gif animations, coordinated for project releases. Features and announcements will be created for social media use. Impression and click-through numbers have shown that a high reach can be achieved with visually appealing material to inform users about the releases and spark deeper engagement.



### Metrics From Phase 2

| Youtube Metric | 6 Month Value |
|----------------|---------------|
| Views          | 23,836        |
| Like %         | 99.2%         |
| Subs Gained    | 504           |
| Subs Lost      | 236           |
| New Comments   | 193           |

Last phase saw a small increase in views and engagement. I attribute this to the exchange rate increase and the impressive 1.6 release.

I believe the real action will start once Decred gets listed on larger fiat exchanges, or once the DEX is user friendly with stable coin pairs - whatever comes first.

Maximum billable amount from Phase 2: $16,200 ($2,700/Month)

Actual billed amount from Phase 2: $6,720

### Budget

Maximum Billable amount of $3,200 USD/Month to be paid in DCR via the Contractor Management System. 

I, Exitus, will manage the proposal and review the billing each month.

Any funds unused will remain in treasury.
